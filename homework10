#10 Homework for Lesson 10 for Monday 12 Feb 2024 by Daniel Clapa

Level 1:

1. The speed control system has the following characteristics:
- at a speed of 50 km/h or less — the system does not respond
- at a speed of more than 50 but less than 55 km/h — the system issues a warning
- at a speed of more than 55, but less than 60 km/h — the system will issue a fine
- at a speed of more than 60 km/h — the driver will receive a fine and a penalty point in
the driver's license

Equivalence classes with their boundary values: 0 — 50 — 55 — 60 — 61+
Boundary values: 50|51 — 55|56 — 60|61+

The speed in the system is measured in integer values. Which of the test data sets can be
used to test all the boundary values of the equivalence classes?

A. 0, 49, 50, 54, 59, 60
B. 50, 55, 60
C. 49, 50, 54, 55, 60, 62
D. 50, 51, 55, 56, 60, 61	← my answer. Correct! (see below)

2. A fitness app counts the number of steps and sends messages to encourage the users to
move. Depending on the number of steps, the feedback will be as follows:

- up to 1000 inclusive – “Couch potato”
- from 1000 to 2000 inclusive – “Bit lazy, huh”
- from 2000 to 4000 inclusive – “Keep moving!”
- from 4000 to 6000 inclusive – “Nice!”
- over 6000 – “Amazing job!”

Equivalence classes: 1000|1001 — 2000|2001 — 4000|4001 — 6000|6001+

Which test data set will provide the best coverage of equivalence classes?
A. 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 
B. 1000, 2001, 4000, 4001, 6000  
C. 123, 2345, 3456, 4567, 5678 
D. 666, 999, 2222, 5555, 6666 	← my answer. Correct! (see below)

Instructor response: “Level 1: The correct answer for both tasks is D. Very well defended here with examples.” 

Level 2:

1. Complete the tasks of the previous level.

2. A device that measures the time and intensity of sunlight received by a plant counts a
combination of parameters: time in the sun (less than 3 hours, 3 to 6 hours, and more than 6
hours) and light intensity (very low, low, medium, high).

There is the following set of tests:



Hours
Intensity
Index of exposure
Test 1
1,5
very low
10
Test 2
7
medium
60
Test 3
0,5
very low
10


What is the minimum number of additional test cases required to ensure that all valid equivalence classes are covered?

A. 1
B. 2	← Correct. See below. 
C. 3	← my answer. Incorrect. 
D. 4

1 more test case for “time in the sun” for the equivalence class “3 to 6 hours”, which is missing from the above set of tests.
2 more test cases, one for the “low” and another one for the “high” light intensities.  

Instructor response: “Level 2: For Task 1: The correct answer here is B. You are correct about the missing scenarios but they can be combined in 2 more scenarios.”

2. The video playback application has requirements. The application will work on devices
with this resolution:

1. 640x480
2. 1280x720
3. 1600x1200
4. 1920x1080

What test case is the result of applying the equivalence partitioning technique? Support
your answer.

A. Check that the application plays video on a 1920x1080 display (1 test case)
B. Check that the application plays video on 640x480 and 1920x1080 displays (2 test
cases)		← my answer. 
C. Check that the application plays video on displays of all sizes specified in the
requirements (4 test cases)
D. Check that the application plays video on any display size specified in the
requirements (1 test case)

The reason just these two test cases would ensure it would work on all these devices is because these two resolutions cover all aspect ratios among these, which is what is important in video playback applications. The table below shows these resolutions’ aspect ratios, which is the result of dividing width by height. Furthermore, these two sizes are the lowest and the highest among these, which should likely ensure those between them would work as well.

Dimensions (width x height)
Aspect Ratio
640x480
4:3
1280x720
16:9
1600x1200
4:3
1920x1080
16:9



Instructor response: “Task 2: The correct answer is C. Your thoughts here are correct but it turned out that because of the specific nature of the resolution, we have to test each one of them separately, that’s why we need 4 cases.”


Level 3:

1. Complete the tasks of the previous two levels.

2. We keep working on a cat photo sharing app.

Write requirements for the app that would regulate the minimum and maximum size of
photos the users can upload to the system. Also, mention the following parameters:
minimum length of comments under photos, maximum length of comments under photos
(the more parameters you come up with, the better).

R1. Allow only file sizes of less than 400 MB. 
Valid equivalence partition: 1 MB to 400 MB. Invalid: 0 MB; 401 MB.
R2. Allow only these commonly used aspect ratios: 1:1, 3:2, 4:3, and 5:4. 
Invalid: all other aspect ratios.
R3. Allow only color depth images having 1-bit, 8-bit or 24-bit.
R4. Allow only one of these image file types to be used: .png, .jpeg, and .gif. 
	Invalid: all other image file types such as .tif, .svg.
R5. Allow a minimum number of 2 characters in the comments under each photo. 
R6. Allow a maximum number of 50 characters in the comments under each photo. 
R7. Allow characters, special characters, and numbers and emoji in the comments under each photo. 

Write test cases that incorporate equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis and
will allow you to verify these requirements.

Part 1: Write requirements for the app that would regulate the minimum and maximum size of
photos the users can upload to the system.

Level 3: Excellent job here with the detailed requirements. Very good job also for the test cases but here you should have done it in table format for BVA and EP, like the example tables in class. However, the test scenarios themselves are correct and good that you have practiced creating them without the TestRail account now


Hi Daniel, Below is my feedback: 

Level 1: The correct answer for both tasks is D. Very well defended here with examples. 

Level 2: For Task 1: The correct answer here is B. You are correct about the missing scenarios but they can be combined in 2 more scenarios. Task 2: the correct answer is C. Your thoughts here are correct but it turned out because of the specific of the resolution, we have to test each one of them separately, that’s why we need 4 cases.
